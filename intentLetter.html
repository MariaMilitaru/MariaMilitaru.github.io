            I am writing this letter to express my interest in the Front Web Developer opening as advertised on
            www.softimpera.ro.
            This position is exactly what I am looking for and an ideal opportunity for me to use my knowledge and
            educational background.
            Also, I am thrilled to learn new technologies and meet new people.
        </p>

        <p>To shortly introduce myself, my name is Maria Militaru and I graduated "Babes-Bolyai University" faculty of
            Mathematics and Computer Science.
            I've always had an artistic view of things and a unique way of thinking. I love seeing visual aesthetic
            webpages and apps and I'm really excited to learn how to put my creative side to work.
            
        </p>
